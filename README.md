# mygit
I am writing a git client from scratch, without looking at git source code. My references are things like the git documentation, youtube videos explaining git internals, some blog posts about git, and some papers about algoriths git uses -- such as the Myers diff algorithm. 

I use git a lot, and want to understand exactly what is going on under the hood. I am attempting to implement as many git commands as I can (both plumbling and porcelain), but there are so many options for each command that it's not really feasible to do it all -- so I'm just picking out what seems interesting, and I'll keep adding to it. 

The implementation is in Python -- not the best for a large project, but oh well, its fast to write and fun :)
